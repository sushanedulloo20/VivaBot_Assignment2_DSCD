Check the functionality of map function implemented by the student. Mapper should send the range of
indices to the mapper to read from  and mapper should read this range directly fromt the file. It
should then call a function to calcualte the nearest centroid of each point and accordingly write
them in the partition file.

Code Evaluation:

    Correctness: The code correctly creates directories for partitions and writes empty strings to
all partition files in the mapper directory. It also reads the points from the file based on the
given start and end indices and calculates the nearest centroid index for each point. Additionally,
it partitions the points based on the nearest centroid index.

Errors: There are no syntactical errors in the code snippet. However, there is a logical error in
the line "for partition_id in range(1, request.no_of_partitions + 1):". This line assumes that the
partition IDs start from 1 and increment by 1, which may not always be the case. It would be better
to use a list or dictionary to store the partition IDs and loop through them, ensuring that all
partitions are accounted for.

Omissions: The code snippet does not include any error handling for when the partition files cannot
be written to or when the points cannot be read from the file. It would be beneficial to include
specific error messages and handle these exceptions accordingly.

Overall Evaluation: The code snippet effectively partitions the data and calculates the nearest
centroids for each point. However, it could be improved by implementing more robust error handling
and considering different scenarios for partition IDs.

Code Summarization and questions:
### Code Summary:

The code defines a method `Map` that is intended to handle mapping tasks in a data processing
framework, likely a map-reduce style distributed computing environment. The main steps of the method
include:

1. Initialization of a directory specific to a mapper based on its port number.
2. Creating or clearing files for data partitions within the mapper's directory.
3. Loading data points from a specified range in a file and processing these points to find their
nearest centroid from a set of centroids.
4. Assigning each point to a partition according to its nearest centroid.
5. Randomly determining the success of the mapping task, with a simulated failure rate. If an
operation fails or an exception is raised, the method returns a failed response.

The method uses exception handling to manage potential failures in its operations, specifically
catching `grpc.RpcError`, `IOError`, and a general `Exception`. This robust handling ensures that,
under any failure circumstances, an appropriate response indicating the failure is returned.

### Relevant Questions:

1. The `calculate_nearest_centroid_index` method is used within the `Map` function. Could you
explain how this method might be implemented? What parameters does it take and what does it return?
How is its result used in determining the partition for a data point?

2. Consider the scenario where the `read_points_from_file` method needs to handle very large files
that do not fit into memory. How would you modify the method to efficiently handle such large data
sets, ensuring minimal memory usage while maintaining the functionality of reading certain ranges of
data points from a file?
