        "question": "\nQuestion: How does Raft handle heartbeats and what is their significance in the consensus process?",
        "model_answer": "\nAnswer: Raft uses heartbeats as a form of communication between servers in the cluster to maintain its leader-follower relationship. The leader sends regular heartbeats to its followers, indicating that it is still alive and functioning. These heartbeats also serve as a way for the leader to keep track of which followers are still active and part of the cluster. In the consensus process, if a follower does not receive a heartbeat from the leader within a certain time period, it will assume that the leader has failed and initiate a new leader election. This ensures that the cluster always has a leader and maintains the consistency of the system.",
